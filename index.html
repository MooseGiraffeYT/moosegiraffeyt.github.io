			<h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
			<p>There's not much to be found here. I'll just be putting some of my projects here.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Hey, I'm CuckyDev! I'm a C++ programmer. I usually just work on whatever projects I'm interested in. If you want to see some of them, consider checking out my <a href="https://github.com/cuckydev/">Github</a></p>
			<p>I've been into programming and creating games for as long as I remember. Going from Scratch, to GameMaker, to Roblox, to where I am today.</p>
			<p>If you want to see random progress updates on whatever I happen to be working on, check out my <a href="https://youtube.com/c/CuckyDev">YouTube</a>.</p>
